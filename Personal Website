      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p> I'm a Senior in Highschool in a STEM program as I plan on pursuing a career in engineering. I'm currently participating in the Pathways program as I'm interested in learning how to code. I love building, designing, and helping others. Whether it’s through STEM, arts and crafts, or solving problems, I’m always looking for  new ideas and making them real.</p>

    <h3 class="fun">Welcome to my website that's all about me yapping about STEM activites and the hobbies I do!!!! :) </h3>
